## Key Testing Features

**Advanced Testing Patterns:**
- Integration tests with real database operations (Supabase)
- Form persistence testing with localStorage cleanup
- Complex DOM mocking for responsive UI components
- OAuth testing with proper window.location mocking

**Quality Assurance:**
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- Modal-based architecture with proper state management testing
- Smart form defaults with dynamic field updates
- RSS feed generation with platform-specific validation

**Professional Setup:**
- TypeScript integration with path mapping
- JSDOM environment with proper URL configuration
- Automated localStorage cleanup between tests
- Modular mock strategy for external dependencies

## Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # All tests
npm test -- --coverage   # With coverage report
npm test -- --watch      # Watch mode
```

## Configuration
The project uses Next.js Jest configuration with custom setup for Supabase, HeroUI components, and navigation mocking. All tests run in isolation with proper cleanup to ensure reliability.
