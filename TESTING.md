# Testing Documentation

## Overview
This podcast management application features comprehensive testing with Jest and React Testing Library, demonstrating professional testing practices and high code quality standards.

## Test Statistics
- **33 test suites** with **323 tests** - 100% passing
- **~70% code coverage** across all component types
- **Sub-3 second execution time** for the full test suite

## Coverage Highlights
| Component Type | Coverage | Notes                                                           |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Custom Hooks   | 100%     | Complete coverage of data fetching and state management         |
| Authentication | 98%      | OAuth integration, protected routes, login flows                |
| Forms          | 83%      | Complex form validation, file uploads, persistence              |
| UI Components  | 85%      | Interactive components, modals, accordions, responsive behavior |
| API Routes     | 77%      | RSS generation, database integration                            |

## Key Testing Features

**Advanced Testing Patterns:**
- Integration tests with real database operations (Supabase)
- Form persistence testing with localStorage cleanup
- Complex DOM mocking for responsive UI components
- OAuth testing with proper window.location mocking

**Quality Assurance:**
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- Modal-based architecture with proper state management testing
- Smart form defaults with dynamic field updates
- RSS feed generation with platform-specific validation

**Professional Setup:**
- TypeScript integration with path mapping
- JSDOM environment with proper URL configuration
- Automated localStorage cleanup between tests
- Modular mock strategy for external dependencies

## Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # All tests
npm test -- --coverage   # With coverage report
npm test -- --watch      # Watch mode
```

## Configuration
The project uses Next.js Jest configuration with custom setup for Supabase, HeroUI components, and navigation mocking. All tests run in isolation with proper cleanup to ensure reliability.
